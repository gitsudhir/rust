Let’s gooo! 📄✨  
A good `README.md` gives your project a clean intro, and it’s perfect for showing off that you're running Rust on ESP32 like a pro.

### 🧾 Here's a starter `README.md` for your project:

# 🚀 ESP32 Hello World in Rust

This is a minimal "Hello, World!" project running on an **ESP32-WROOM-32** using the **Rust language** and the [`esp-idf`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf) framework.

> ✅ Successfully tested on Windows with COM6 and cargo-espflash

---

## 📦 Features

- Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Uses [`esp-idf-svc`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf) and `log` for system logging
- Prints a friendly message over UART:

```
😁Hello, Sudhir
```

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitsudhir/rust.git
cd rust
```

### 2. Install prerequisites

- Rust (nightly): `rustup default nightly`
- Add ESP32 target:  
  ```bash
  rustup target add xtensa-esp32-espidf
  ```
- Install `espup` tools:
  ```bash
  cargo install espup
  espup install
  ```

### 3. Flash to ESP32

Make sure your board is connected via USB (e.g., `COM6`):

```bash
cargo espflash flash --port COM6 --monitor
```
------rerun------
```bash
cargo clean
cargo build
cargo espflash flash --port COM6
cargo espflash flash --port COM6 --monitor
```
