# Path
Awesome! Here's a **Docker Beginner Cheat Sheet + Challenge** to help you (or other devs) **master the essentials quickly** and build real confidence 🚀

---

# 🧾 **Docker Beginner Cheat Sheet (with Examples)**

## 🐳 1. **Run a Container (Temporary)**

```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
```

✅ Runs and removes the container after execution.

---

## 📦 2. **Run a Container with a Shell**

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

✅ Starts an interactive terminal (`-it`) inside Ubuntu.

---

## 📁 3. **Mount Local Code (Live File Access)**

```bash
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/app" -w /app node:20 node app.js
```

✅ Runs your local `app.js` with Node.js inside Docker.

---

## 🌐 4. **Expose Container to Host (Ports)**

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
```

✅ Maps container’s port 80 to your host’s port 8080. Visit: `http://localhost:8080`

---

## 🐳 5. **Create a Dockerfile**

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:20
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

✅ Defines a custom image for your app.

---

## 🏗️ 6. **Build and Run Your Image**

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

---

## 🧱 7. **Use docker-compose for Multi-Container Apps**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

```bash
docker-compose up
```

---

# 🏁 Beginner Docker Challenge (Try This!)

### 🔧 Goal:

Build and run a Node.js or Python app inside Docker **with hot reloading**, using only Docker.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Challenge

### 1. Create a project folder:

```bash
mkdir docker-dev && cd docker-dev
```

### 2. Add a sample app (e.g., `index.js`):

```js
// index.js
console.log("Hello from Docker at", new Date());
```

### 3. Add a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "dockertest",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 4. Create a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:20
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 5. Run it with volume mount:

```bash
docker build -t docker-node-dev .
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "${PWD}:/app" \
  -w /app \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  docker-node-dev
```

Now edit `index.js`, save — and boom, it reloads.
